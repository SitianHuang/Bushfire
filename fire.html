             <p>The 2019-2020 Victoria bushfire season was catastrophic in the scale of damage caused to

                <h2>Cause of Bushfires and Distance to the Nearest CFA Station in Victoria</h2>
                <p>From the map we can see that lightning was the main cause of Victorian bushfires,
                    with accident and burning off followed. Dry lightning represents the main source of 
                    natural ignition, and fires that start in remote areas far away from CFA stations 
                    are difficult to access and monitor, where would be easier to caught fire.</p>

                <h2>Effect of Temperature, Solar Exposure and Wind Speed on Cause of Bushfires</h2>
                <p>This plot shows the main weather and climate characteristics of this disaster in terms of the ralationship 
                    of 3 significant factors. Clearly most of the bushfires were caught in high-level 
                    solar exposure and relatively hot days, while the wind speed seems to show random clustering and
                    have less influence.  </p>

                    <h2>Forest Category and Type that Caught Bushires</h2>
                    <p>The following 2 charts illustrate the forest category and type that caught bushfires, which are helpful
                        to identify which kind of trees or forest are more easier to catch fire. Native forest takes the 
                        largest angle in the radial plot and the highest figure of Native forest within the stacked bar chart 
                        is Forest Eucalypt Medium Open, which is also the second highest category except the total Non forest.
